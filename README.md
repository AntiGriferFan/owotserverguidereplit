# OWOT Server Guide Replit
This tutorial will show you how to make an OWOT server.
# Making a Replit Account
To make a Repl.it account, go to https://replit.com/signup. You can also make your Repl.it account with Google.
Once you're done, press Create Account and then Sign in.
# Making a OWOT server
When you open Repl.it, you will see something that looks like this:

Click Create Repl, click Import From Github, then clone the repo from github.com/system2k/NodeWorldOfText, or download it and put it in the filesystem of your Repl.
# Starting the server and configuring it
At the right, you will see a tab saying Configure Repl, you can set it to node runserver.js, node index.js or npm run start.
Click done, then press the Start button at the top of the window.

It will install the node modules, then tell you to change the settings file. (Optional)
It's unknown how you could edit the settings.json, but it's optional.

Press start again, then it should ask you to create a superuser. It's recommended to make one.

The URL should end somewhere like NodeWorldOfText.replitusername.repl.co.
